[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/stacc-dasso/woocommerce-extension.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.com/stacc-dasso/woocommerce-extension)

### Installing

A step by step tutorial to get the extension up and running.
1. Install WordPress
2. Install WooCommerce
3. Download ZIP of the latest release from [here](https://github.com/stacc-dasso/woocommerce-extension/releases)
4. Upload the ZIP file through WordPress's admin panel plugin install functionality

## Deployment

Currently it isn't possible to connect to the API without the help of the authors of the plugin.
Because of this, most of the functionality can't be seen.

For logging (by default debug loggins is disabled) we use WooCommerce logger, so the logs will available from:  
`Dashboard -> WooCommerce -> Status -> Logs -> StaccDefault.log`

To see if the events are caught you can also enable [wordpress logging](https://codex.wordpress.org/Debugging_in_WordPress),
which makes some basic data visible on:  
`wp-content/debug.log`
